Source Code [here](http://zenbhang.github.io/alfredproject).\r\n\r\n## Rainmeter Related Work\r\n  I made a custom skin based on the **Monstercat Player** by **i077**. It garnered notable attention on **[Reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/Rainmeter/comments/2eqmyi/saw_the_monstercat_media_player_and_made_a/)** and on **[Deviantart](http://zenbhang.deviantart.com/art/Monstercat-Player-Zenbhang-Edition-1-0-478492311)**.\r\n\r\n  Source for the Monstercat Player found [here](https://github.com/zenbhang/Monstercat-Player--Zenbhang-Edition-).\r\n\r\n  I also created a UI bar similar to the above concept, that was featured in many Rainmeter communities found [here](http://zenbhang.deviantart.com/art/The-Zen-Bar-1-1-350710793). \r\n\r\n  As of **6/11/2015**, the day I made this .io page, **22,779** users have viewed the skins, and **4,649** users have downloaded and use the skin. More can be found [here](http://zenbhang.deviantart.com/).\r\n \r\n  **Rainmeter** is a GUI skinning tool that allows users to put overlays on their desktop.
