I realized Siri, in all its ambition, was buckling on its own weight. Thus, I had based the project idea on 3 fundamental basis:\r\n### Accessibility\r\nI wanted to make something that was more than a huge block of code. Everything throughout is highly commented and my full intentions with the code can be seen.\r\n### Usability\r\nI wanted to make a piece of software that even a child could use, but also a piece of software that a developer wouldn't feel unsupported in using. Thus, I began my quest, researching UI constructs and the ideas that are behind a good GUI. In its current state, the UI is probably the best part, fully capable of many of the functions needed to make the software accessible.\r\n### Modularity\r\nI wanted it to be able to be modular, so it would be able to inject code from other sources. A bit ambitious considering my limited programming skills at the time.  In its current state, it has the backbone of a structure allowing it to be modular, however, I never spent too much time working on this aspect.\r\n\r\n###Current State\r\nThings that are done:\r\n-TTS (Text to Speech) [output]\r\n\r\n-Recognition of strings\r\n\r\n-manual input\r\n\r\n-web based uses\r\n\r\n-time and date\r\n\r\nThings not done:\r\n-STT (Speech to Text) [input]\r\n\r\n-Modular implementation\r\n\r\n-Anything that was too ambitious\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
