<a id="who-am-i" class="anchor" href="#who-am-i" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Who Am I?</h1>

<p>I am currently an Production Management Technology Associate at the <strong>Wells Fargo N.A.</strong> corporate offices.</p>

<p>I specialize in Computer programming, infrastructure, and security.

<p>I have a <strong>Computer Science BA</strong> from the University of Minnesota - Twin Cities. </p>

<p>For the summer of 2016, I was an intern at Wells Fargo in downtown Minneapolis for their Technology Operations Group Intern Program in the Production Management Technologies Department. </p>

<p>Before that, during the school year, I was a Student Database Technician for the University of Minnesota's Disability Resource Center. </p> 

<p>For the 2015-2016 academic year, I was the acting <strong>Vice-Chair</strong> of <strong>IEEE</strong> (Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers).</p>

<p>I work on many side projects, some with friends and colleauges I met at the University of Minnesota, some I work on personally.</p>

<p>I have programmed several popular Rainmeter skins, most notably, a revision of the <strong>Monstercat Player</strong> as well as the self-dubbed <strong>Zen Bar</strong>, detailed below.</p>

<p>I am also currently curating the defunct AlfredProject, a project that I started early in high school. </p>

<p>A project idea that was the result of a lack of sleep and badly written CSCI lab assignments. Originally a joke made from a mistake, Matt Schultz and I decided to put the idea in action. <br>

<p>After being frustrated playing competitve team based video games where the team did anything but be a team. I wondered if I truly did belong at the Matchmaking ranking (MMR) I was stuck at or if I was just a result of a bad algorithm. The only way to truly find out was to create a simulator that would show the long term effects of such an algorithm. <br>

<p>A hair salon I had been going to since I was a toddler, Salon Ling has been a part of my life for a long time. I was surprised to see that they had no website, so I made one from scratch. Mobile friendly, and 5 MB of hosting size, this was the first site I made from the ground up. <br>

<p>I made a custom skin based on the <strong>Monstercat Player</strong> by <strong>i077</strong>. It garnered notable attention on <strong><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Rainmeter/comments/2eqmyi/saw_the_monstercat_media_player_and_made_a/">Reddit</a></strong> and on <strong><a href="http://zenbhang.deviantart.com/art/Monstercat-Player-Zenbhang-Edition-1-0-478492311">Deviantart</a></strong>.</p>

<p>Source for the Monstercat Player found <a href="https://github.com/zenbhang/Monstercat-Player--Zenbhang-Edition-">here</a>.</p>

<p>I also created a UI bar similar to the above concept, that was featured in many Rainmeter communities found <a href="http://zenbhang.deviantart.com/art/The-Zen-Bar-1-1-350710793">here</a>. </p>

<p>As of <strong>6/11/2015</strong>, the day I made this .io page, <strong>22,779</strong> users have viewed the skins, and <strong>4,649</strong> users have downloaded and use the skin. More can be found <a href="http://zenbhang.deviantart.com/">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Rainmeter</strong> is a GUI skinning tool that allows users to put overlays on their desktop. More info at: <a href="http://rainmeter.net/">http://rainmeter.net/</a></p>
